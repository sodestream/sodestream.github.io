    <h2>About</h2>
    

    <p>The sodestream project was originally funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences
Research Council, under grants EP/S033564/1 and EP/S036075/1.</p>
<h3>Project abstract</h3>
<p>Many decisions in today's world are made through a complex, dynamic process of
interaction and communication between people and teams with different interests
and priorities - so called "distributed decision-making" (DDM). For example,
many businesses work across multiple geographically dispersed offices and
timezones, with teams specialising in quite diverse areas. Each team may have
its own goals and reward models, which do not necessarily coincide, and may be
spread across multiple organisational units (e.g. different businesses or
governments). Communication may happen via several different modalities with
very different timescales and properties (e.g. email, instant messenger, and
face-to-face meetings).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, although many organisations have started to document these
processes and even make records available (particularly governmental
organisations e.g. <a href="https://data.gov.uk">data.gov.uk</a>), we have no way to automatically
analyse these records. If we did, we could produce tools to automatically
summarise decisions, trace who made them, and why and how they were made (and
why other decisions weren't made). From a societal standpoint this would help
make these processes more accountable and transparent. We'd also be able to
identify collaborative failures, biases and other problems, and thus help
improve decision-making in future.</p>
<p>This project will develop these urgently required methods, using a combination
of natural language processing and social network analysis. We will collate,
annotate and publicly release the first multimodal dataset of real-world
distributed decision-making. We will devise techniques to take natural language
and semi-structured data to recognise the dialogue and interaction structures in
decision making, and analyse those structures to produce summaries and evaluate
the efficacy of the decision making process. We will then use the outputs to
inform strategic interventions that can streamline and improve decision making.</p>
<p>Our methods will be suitably generic to span several domains. However, the
project will focus on one particular global organisation as its main use case:
the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). This is an international forum
responsible for producing Internet protocol standards - formal documents which
specify the languages by which software and hardware "speak" across the
Internet. To produce these documents, extensive international collaboration is
performed - this spans several modalities including email discussions,
collaborative document editing, face-to-face meetings and teleconferencing.
Importantly, all of these modalities are documented via transparency reports
ranging from public email archives to minutes from meetings. This project has
partnered with the IETF to help model and streamline their decision making
process. We will borrow from their experience, and employ our methods to extract
decision making bottlenecks. We will devise tooling which will provide advice
and proposed interventions to relevant parties within the IETF. Amongst many
other things, we directly benefit the IETF, and the global Internet standards
community, by helping them to uncover biases and help make important decision
processes accountable.</p>
