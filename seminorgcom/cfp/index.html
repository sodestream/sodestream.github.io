<p><h3>Main topics:</h3></p>
	<p>	We welcome work broadly in the area of natural language processing, computational linguistics, computational social science, sociolinguistics, organisational psychology, and related fields with the 
aim of better understanding organisational communication. Cross-disciplinary collaborations between computer scientists and other social scientists  in order to reach richer insights are especially welcome. 
We also encourage contributions that address multilingual settings as well as low-resource languages. The workshop topics include but are not limited to:

<ul class="round">
<li>Summarization of meetings and other organisational communication</li>
<li>Models of argument, (dis)agreement and decision-making</li>
<li>Analysis of influence, persuasiveness and power relations</li>
<li>Effects of organisational culture and hierarchy</li>
<li>Communication across different modalities and timescales</li>
<li>Differences between organisational communication and other forms of communication</li>
<li>Datasets and annotation schemas for organisational communication</li>
<li>Social network analysis in organisations as applied to communication</li>
<li>Diachronic analysis of organisational communication</li>
<li>Application and adaptation of NLP models to organisational communication.</li>
</ul>
</p>



<p><h3>Format:</h3></p>

<p><b>Regular submissions (long and short)</b></p>

<p>
Authors are invited to submit full papers of up to 8 pages of content and short papers of up to 4 pages of content, with unlimited pages for references. 
Accepted papers will be given an additional page of content to address reviewer comments, and will be published in the ACL Anthology. Previously published 
papers cannot be accepted. Dual submissions are allowed; papers that are currently undergoing review at other venues are welcome, but must declare this on submission.

</p>


<p><b>Non-archival submissions</b></p>

<p>We welcome two types of non-archival submissions. First, you can submit an extended abstract of work not published elsewhere. These can include position papers, or early stage work that would benefit from peer feedback. 
Second, work previously accepted/published elsewhere, along with details about the venue or journal where it is accepted, and a link 
to the archived version, if available. In both cases there are no page limits, or style/anonymity requirements, and the submissions will be reviewed only for the fit to the workshop theme. 
Papers accepted as non-archival will be given an opportunity to present the work at the workshop, but will not be published in the ACL Anthology (they will be available on the workshop website).</p>




<p><b>Hackathon submissions</b></p>
<p>An active, experimentation-based track where hackathon-type online activities precede the workshop, and teams/individuals present their work in the workshop. The hackathon organisers will provide data, task suggestions, and periodic feedback. Though, participants are free to work on any relevant task or dataset during their hackathon project. Hackathon activities are by design online, while the rest of the workshop will be in person. Hackathon participants are invited (but not required) to submit a system description paper (up to 4 pages + unlimited pages for references); authors will be able to choose whether these are published in the ACL anthology.</p>

<p><b>Journal special issue</b></p>

<p>After the workshop, we will explore the possibility of inviting selected authors to submit a paper to a special issue of the Dialogue & Discourse journal. The journal submissions would undergo further review, and the paper should be substantially different from the original work. </p>

<p><b>Submission instructions:</b></p>
<p>Similar to IWCS, submissions should be fully anonymous to ensure double-blind reviewing. All submissions should follow the IWCS conference template (see <a href="https://iwcs2023.loria.fr/call-for-papers/">https://iwcs2023.loria.fr/call-for-papers/</a>)  </p>
