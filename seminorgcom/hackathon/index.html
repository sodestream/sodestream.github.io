	<h2>Why participate?</h2>
	<p>
	 Would you like to tackle exciting challenges in analysing organisational communication? Or do you like developing and experimenting with solutions in a multidisciplinary setting? 
	Or are you possibly interested in multilingual settings, smaller languages, or low-resource languages? Or would you like to learn things about NLP hands on, and from working with others? 
    </p>
	
    <p>We will provide guidelines on tools and datasets participants could use in their experiments, as well as periodical feedback from experts in both computer science and humanities fields. 
	However, this is purely optional and participants can choose any task or methodology to work on, provided it is aligned with the workshop topics (see call for papers).</p>

    <p>The hackathon targets anyone interested in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning applied to better understanding organisational communication (doctoral and graduate students, researchers and professionals). 
	We especially welcome researchers from related CS fields (cross-lingual or low-resource NLP) or those from social sciences who are keen to participate in cross-disciplinary teams.</p>

	
	<h2>Registration</h2>
	<p>To register please fill in <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYgxW6vv8eJyo1l13LV8w-d_Ex0O11ifqsfma12SpoQ7bTuw/viewform">this form</a>. You may register as an individual participant (unless you register very late, you will be given an option to team up with other participants) or as a team. 
	When registering as a team <b>each team member</b> needs to register separately, but you should all supply the same team name.</p>
